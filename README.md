# Purpose

The mission of the ELISA project is to define and maintain a common set of elements, processes and tools that can be incorporated into Linux-based, safety-critical systems amenable to safety certification.

# Workgroups

The project is still forming, and the proposed workgroups are
* Component Quality Assurance Working Group
* Tooling Development Working Group
* Incident and Hazard monitoring Working Group
* Compliance and Certification Working Group
* Reference Use Case Working Group

As the leadership for each workgroup is established, a link to the WIKI page will be added to the list above.

# Goals 
* A set of elements, processes and tools to support safety certification of Linux-based systems.
* A Linux-based reference system to focus the activities of the project.
* Companies are able to incorporate the output of the project into products.
* The open source community, safety community, regulation authorities,  standards bodies and system developers all accept the project work.
